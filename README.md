# hands_on_machine_learning

In this repository I disponibilize the notebooks I've used to go through the book 'Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow", Aurélien Géron. 

The notebooks are intended to be read with the book in hands, however from an experienced user they can be a used as an easy way to consult some basic ideas of machine learning algorithms.

They all written in English, but don't expect a perfect grammar. It isn't my master thesis and I propousely spent more time coding then making it grammarly concise.

Please fell free to contact me if you have any questions the way I reproduce the ideas of the book or want to discuss some concept.

Hope you enjoy!
