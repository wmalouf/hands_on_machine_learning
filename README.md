# hands_on_machine_learning

In this repository, I make available the notebooks I've used to go through the book 'Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow", Aurélien Géron. 

The notebooks are intended to be read with the book in hands, however from an experienced user they can be used as an easy way to consult some basic ideas of machine learning algorithms.

They all written in English, but don't expect perfect grammar. It isn't my master thesis and I purposely spent more time coding then making it grammarly concise.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions the way I reproduce the ideas of the book or want to discuss some concept.

Hope you enjoy!
